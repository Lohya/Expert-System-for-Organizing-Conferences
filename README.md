                                           EXPERT SYSTEM FOR ORGANIZING CONFERENCES
In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. 
Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if-then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. 

The first expert systems were created in the 1970’s and they proliferated in the 1980’s. Expert systems were among the first truly successive forms of artificial intelligence software. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities. An expert system is an AI software that uses knowledge stored in a knowledge base to solve problems that would usually require a human expert thus preserving a human expert’s knowledge in its knowledge base. They can advise users as well as provide explanations to them about how they reached a particular conclusion or advice.
An expert system is an example of a knowledge-based system. 

Expert systems were the first commercial systems to use a knowledge-based architecture. A knowledge-based system is essentially composed of two sub-systems: the knowledge base and the inference engine.
The knowledge base represents facts about the world. In early expert systems such as Mycin and Dendral, these facts were represented mainly as flat assertions about variables. In later expert systems developed with commercial shells, the knowledge base took on more structure and used concepts from object-oriented programming. The world was represented as classes, subclasses, and instances and assertions were replaced by values of object instances. The rules worked by querying and asserting values of the objects.

What are Expert Systems?

The expert systems are the computer applications developed to solve complex problems in a particular domain, at the level of extraordinary human intelligence and expertise.

Following are Important characteristic of Expert System:
The Highest Level of Expertise: The expert system offers the highest level of expertise. It provides efficiency, accuracy and imaginative problem-solving.

Right on Time Reaction: An Expert System interacts in a very reasonable period with the user. The total time must be less than the time taken by an expert to get the most accurate solution for the same problem.

Good Reliability: The expert system needs to be reliable, and it must not make any mistakes.

Flexible: It is vital that it remains flexible as it the is possessed by an Expert system.

Effective Mechanism: Expert System must have an efficient mechanism to administer the compilation of the existing knowledge in it.

Capable of handling challenging decision & problems: An expert system is capable of handling challenging decision problems and delivering solutions.

Knowledge Base:

A knowledge base is a database used for knowledge sharing and management. It promotes the collection, organization, and retrieval of knowledge. Many knowledge bases are structured around artificial intelligence and not only store data but find solutions for further problems using data from previous experience stored as part of the knowledge base.
Knowledge-based computer-aided systems engineering (KB-CASE) tools assist designers by providing suggestions and solutions, thereby helping to investigate the results of design decisions. The knowledge base analysis and design allow users to frame knowledge bases, from which informative decisions are made.

Steps for Organising Conferences:

Step1: Decide on a theme.

Step2: Assemble your team.

Step3: Prepare a budget and a business plan.

Step4: Finding sponsors &grants.

Step5: Settle on a date.

Step6: Book the venue.

Step7: Arrange catering and other vendors.

Step8: Line up your speakers.

Step9: Put together an agenda.

Step10: Start registering attendees.

Step11: Promote your conference.

Step12: Take care of on-site planning.

Step13: Host the conference.

Step14: Follow up after the conference.



METHODOLOGY:


The activities of the organization workshop are categorized into three different modules that are 

•	Pre-conference activities

•	In-workshop activities

•	Post-conference activities

In pre-workshop activities there will be registering organizers and registering students for workshop. Here constraint satisfaction problem is used for registering students for workshop since, he/she can register to a single workshop at a time and Depth First Search s(DFS) is used for conducting workshop only for more than 20 members since, we can’t afford so much money for bringing resource person for conducting workshop. In In-workshop activities there will be taking attendance for the students who had attended for working for this we are using Back tracking using DFS since, the person who is present in first class he/she should be attend up to attend class so there will be taking attendance at starting and at ending. 
In post-workshop activities there will be providing certificates and taking review from students and resource person. Constraint Satisfaction problem (CSP) is used in feedback from students since, student can give review only once and generally we say what we are doing at first time should be perfect.

DFS Algorithm pseudocode:

      Function CONSISTENT (participant_count)
      
              If participant_count<50
              
                     return FALSE
                     
               return TRUE
               
Constraint Satisfaction Problem Pseudocode:

     Function CONSISTENT ()
     
               If participant_exist==true
               
                   return FALSE
                   
                return TRUE
